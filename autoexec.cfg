//About graphics
//Just max settings with reflex, anyway cs2 is rrly CPU intensive game, also can use normally about 4 cores, 
//others works only for better frametime, so the best way is to have not high FPS but stable, so you can choose best graphics
//in NVIDIA settings enable FULL output dynamic range(in Change resolution)
//any other settings in NVIDIA Control panel not rrly change significantly experience
//also play 16x9 because when most players play on 16x9, 4x3 is unplayable if rrly
//brightness have to be in range 80-110%(110% is maybe too enough)
//launch options -high -novid -console +exec autoexec

//For hosting workshop map use host_workshop_map (id of map) //example for awp_india host_workshop_map 3070290869
